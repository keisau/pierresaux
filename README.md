## Making your one!
I am planning to make a simplified tutorial covering latest version of React, React Router, etc. Or you can dig into this site to get some insight. Perhaps this will be cool enough.

To make your own one, create a repository with the name `<your account>.github.io.git` and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/pierresaux/pierresaux.git
git clone https://github.com/<your account>/<your account>.github.io.git
```

## Running and Testing
```
npm run dev-server
```

## Production
By default, the distribution direction is `../pierresaux.github.io`. You may rename it to fit your github account. Make sure you've cloned a copy of your github site to the corresponding path (in my case, that is `../pierresaux.github.io`).

### Cleaning
```
npm run clean
```

### Building
```
npm run build
```
